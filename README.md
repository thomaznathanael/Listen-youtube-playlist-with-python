This is an example of how to listen music from a youtube playlist.

## Installation

Install the all dependencies

Execute the follow command on terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### And install the VLC App in your device.

## Usage

You just need to replace the playlist url and open.

```python

...

url = "PUT_YOUR_YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL_HERE"

...

```
For the next song press the "Page Up" key on your keyboard.

### The Keyboard library uses root authentication to work fine.

If you're using a linux system and do not want to use root authentication you may use the Enter to go to next song.
