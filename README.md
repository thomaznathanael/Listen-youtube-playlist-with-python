This is an example of how to listen music from a youtube playlist.

## Installation

Install the all dependencies

Execute the follow command on terminal:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You just need to replace the playlist url and open.

```python

...

url = "PUT_YOUR_YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL_HERE"

...

```
For the next song press the "Page Up" key on your keyboard.

Some Linux systems do not work well with the keyboard library, so you need to press Enter to play the next song.
